##Project Description
As part of my internship at CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS, I was assigned Task-3: to build a Neural Style Transfer Tool using Python. The aim was to implement a model that transfers the artistic style of one image (e.g., a painting) onto the content of another (e.g., a photo). This task allowed me to explore key concepts in deep learning and computer vision, especially using pre-trained TensorFlow models.

I used Google Colab for execution and testing, which helped me overcome local environment limitations. The final output showcases how a content image is stylized using the style of another image.

üß† Key Learnings and Implementation

‚ÄÇ1. Neural Style Transfer Concept

Learned the idea of combining content features of one image with style features of another using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Understood how pretrained models can accelerate and simplify deep learning tasks.

‚ÄÇ2. TensorFlow Hub

Used TensorFlow Hub to load a lightweight, pre-trained style transfer model:
https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2

‚ÄÇ3. Image Preprocessing

Loaded and resized both content and style images using Pillow and NumPy.

Normalized image data before feeding it to the model.

‚ÄÇ4. Stylization and Output

Performed style transfer using the loaded model.

Displayed and saved the stylized output using matplotlib and PIL.
